## 1. Preface

### 1.1 README

This user guide covers setup, installation, and usage of the gem5 GUI. The purpose of this guide is to provide users with a high-level understanding of the features and components of the GUI, answer any questions about its operation, and highlight differences between the configuring architectural simulations via scripts and via the gem5 GUI.

### 1.2 Audience
This user guide is intended for those who wish to carry out architectural simulations using gem5's GUI interface, as opposed to the use of configuration scripts and new users who are unfamiliar with how gem5 works. For new users, highlighted terms and sections will indicate background information necessary for understanding the proper usage of the GUI. Experienced users can skip these sections.


## 2. Overview

### 2.1 Background

Currently, gem5 is an open source project used to simulate computer architecture. gem5 was originally developed for computer architecture research withinin academia. However, it has since been extended and found use in industry, full computer system design, and as an education tool for computer architecture students. Most gem5 development involves specifying architectural models via python scripts. Though powerful, this introduces a steep learning curve to the product. To make gem5 more accessible and user-friendly, we have created a graphical user interface for gem5; the details of which are outlined in this document.

### 2.2 Description

We developed a user interface whichs allows users to search through a library of simobject, configure them, and place them in an architectural heirarchy to then be instantiate and simulated. Users can then save these heirarchies in UI files that they can load later and edit further. 


### 2.3 Design

The image below represents the basic structure of the GUI, as well as a very high level overview of interaction with our &quot;back-end&quot;, which in this case was the gem5 repository. Our GUI has a distinct front-end and back-end, which are linked by a State class and the SymObject class.

### 2.4 Technical Specifications

#### 2.4.1 PySide2

We decided to develop the GUI using Python. Therefore, the natural choice was to use the Python binding for QT, one of the most popular GUI development libraries. We chose PySide2 over PyQt5 as would require a commercial license for release.


## 3. Installation and Setup

### 3.1 Prerequisites

The gem5 GUI builds atop gem5. gem5 must be compiled and run within a linux operating system. Due to gem5 being linux native, this GUI can not be developed cross-platform. You need to have a compiled gem5 installation on your machine. Visit [gem5 download](http://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/building) for instructions on how to setup gem5. You also need **Python3** in order to run the GUI as well. 

### 3.2 Basic Setup

To begin the setup process, clone the [repository](https://github.com/afarooqui98/gem5_GUI) directly into the gem5 directory. Once complete, enter into the gem5\_GUI directory and download the dependencies using:

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

### 3.3 Running the application

Once the dependencies are installed, users can run the GUI with the command:

```<gem5.opt path> gui.py```

## 4. Features and Functionality

### 4.1 GUI Overview

Attached below is a view of the GUI on successful launch:

**![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/CFVJ2WTCP-fm_eeWc1hU_a3kHUz9TNeFe7y2UpBRp8JfrFWwZfPxxWh_QshoAuESh_zDqXyp6_G2bf4PeKuDuI4COeeS1KNhSxXhTHBsy2ZYZX60d6R73K4BQ3e6vQ5xgj8yhwSs)**

On the left side lies the **catalog view** as well as the **attribute view**.

The former is used to select a SimObject, and the latter will be used to configure a selected SimObject. The majority of the screen is populated by the **canvas**. This is where most of the user interaction will occur, and where users will build their system. The menu bar contains multiple convenience functions typical to GUI software, from copy-pasting to file saving, but there are also tabs for **debugging** , **running** , and **importing**. These are key functions of the GUI that work in tandem with gem5 to provide the users with the ability to check their system configuration, import both ui objects and configured subclasses, and instantiate their systems. The buttom for drawing ports between objects can be found directly below the 'File' menu button.

### 4.2 Catalog View

**![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/iv-iXWbl-zvDkwHlkJ9Adlp4xjj-vP9g_kb4yZYRMtSTrtOUnrlsVTdY73JieBOCWHBDno7JHm0YxuohtawUyQ5tb1EjewX45XU6Q5Z8NOC8WoIYGeZECXX4tcqR5dfbEmMt7Hp6)**

The catalog holds all the available SimObjects. Users can maneuver the tree view by specific category or search for an object via the search bar. Double clicking an object places what we call a SymObject on the canvas. A SymObject is a GUI representation of an gem5 SimObject that allows a user to interact with it in a tactile way.

### 4.3 Attribute Table

**![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gxPj5FWqqfpwkIxH--c_LYTa0eCnfYEqxaqX2iR7ZFf9UwyQQSWjLWBjjDDfbSJrE-0oWVk9rkpOMOZnRdcNzUXfyP8h1144lTWUn-Hgt96BeBitZqRTqXr8Bv8A6RCwkzb7kOdt)**

Selecting an object brings up its attribute table. This table lists the object name, every child object, as well as all the object parameters. The parameter fields are modifiable, while the &quot;Name&quot; and &quot;Child Objects&quot; fields are only viewable. Hovering over the parameter name gives a description of the parameter, hovering over the value shows the type. Attributes for the specific object may also be searched for, aside from the &quot;Name&quot; and &quot;Child Objects&quot; parameters, which always lie at the top of the table.

### 4.4 Wiring

To enable wire drawing, click the wire icon between the menu and the catalog. While in wire drawing mode, objects cannot be interacted with. Clicking this button changes the cursor to a cross hair, allowing the user to connect ports with wires. Failing to connect two ports or connecting incompatible ports will result in an error message. Right clicking a wire brings up a context menu, which will allow for deletion and inspection.

**![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/k3X4PbsV-p_0oNeMGzexuSvBhwoxifQ28G0GGwRPh3QdDB7Q_zl1dCq-dSx7yF7OOA5lsIbB2maPyrQl_yaHlal2H-QIfMKeph4FpgnbwPfTdk0qWnVR9CFmdGq7VeEDV1wT5I9Q)**

### 4.5 Context

An important part of understanding the gem5 GUI is the way user context works. Whenever an object is created or selected, it is set as the current selected SymObject. Selected objects are typically highlighted in green, unless there are required attributes that need to be set by the user; then, the object is red. Any time an object is selected, the user can move it around freely and resize it in the canvas, with its attributes populated in the attribute table. Finally, it&#39;s important to note that wiring _is not_ dependent on the current context, so any ports for any objects may be connected to others regardless of whether they are in context.

### 4.6 Menu Overview
The menu contains tools to interact with the GUI. Most of these correspond to self explanatory standard window functionality, and all options in the menu correspond to a keyboard shortcut.

### 4.7 Run

**![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/w7zPXdpEmfvKHBrRCVVazTPXdZGHD4JeemIjvkwXMbomtK5lTdlMmlwplL3d6lF66SYRkinzCPXO1FbHSE4Ou-RjZbbX17yxBO1zkqwt6NBYw23eF7eRHQUiYMHP_WxubpwfzqVR)**

The run tab contains the instantiate and simulate option. Please note both are greyed out until a user drops in at least a root object to prevent the user from instantiating without a root. Once the instantiate button is pressed, the user _must_ save the file (since objects cannot be modified once instantiated), after which the results of instantiation are displayed within the command line. Once instantiation is complete, the user can press the simulate button, which will begin the simulation of the design with the output in the command line interface.

### 4.8 Debug

**![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Plh1yAE1Sx3wgVY3w-fHRgmEh1ZyY2uCe0O2SX1984lYe4kgiUJH-C6_2aLZngWX0-eraXf8m--xC--ouErySfQJFGbAkLe-TuzNa3O5QKRf6F-UAThoJ5oyWi0KRsgLLH6LQVU2)**

By pressing the Debug button on the toolbar, the debug window will appear on the right side of the GUI. There will be two checkboxes: &quot;Log to File&quot; and &quot;Log to Stdout,&quot; with the former being set automatically. Logging to file will send debug and error messages to a file which can be renamed at any time in the text below. Logging to stdout will print these messages in the Terminal application running the GUI. Below these options is a table of debug flags that native to the gem5 system. These flags can be set and unset, and result in different gem5 debug messages. They are also searchable by an accompanying search bar.

### 4.9 Import and Export UI Objects

**![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/siEBwmcd6tGS7QHymwpDtJK7Is0zEQFH30jnCnhSTcjVKfo7rD3oPJskbw_Cty_lu05ifpWIkkwO3wKJqMoDKqtL7XqrEgVqwAXp9X57DmRIjZqkMRpErWt1kLeJYvXZ9Qn2YftK)**

Under file, we have import and export UI object, which allow users to save and load clusters of SymObjects. Exporting saves the configuration as a .obj file, which is in a JSON format (to differntiate these types of files we use the .obj extension). Importing places the custom object in the catalog, allowing for the same access methods as regular SimObjects.

### 4.10 Import SimObject

**![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4ZZ0gDvbqz6o9YIB4-pHTZUBB2Cpxwd7CnC2szd_-dy-fO88NMUCzU1I6YmRTR_oSYgk5wgHl8gce3AAXd3RF7iRJcIZ9mU-qgJyBx13WN-7Ploe03yXLUQHQBnSpfUOaNo-AJoB)**

Users can import custom SimObjects, which are python classes inherited from base SimObjects. These imports appear under the catalog, and can be similarly added to the GUI just like regular objects. Imported SimObjects are saved as part of a .ui file, so you do not need to import again when opening a .ui file with imported SimObjects.

## 5. Troubleshooting

### 5.1 Could not load Qt platform plugin even though it was found

This error can come up if you ssh into a machine to run the GUI. Including the -Y option may fix this error

### 5.2 ImportError: No module named PySide2

When running the GUI this error might appear. This usually means either of the following has occurred:

- PySide2 was not installed. Use `pip show PySide2` to make sure it is installed on your machine and if not make sure to run `pip -r install requirments.txt`
- When installing PySide2 in a virtual environment it can become binded to a particular version of Python that is not being used in the virtual environment. If PySide2 is installed and you are using a virtual environment to run the GUI, try going through the installation steps again without the virtual environment.

## 6. Appendix

### 6.1 Requirements

Must Haves:

- Users can drag and drop new SimObjects into a model and connect them with wires.

    - Each SimObject has a GUI representation which is then stored in what we&#39;ll refer to as a &quot;catalog&quot;
      - These objects will be generated dynamically from the current SimObjects available in gem5
      - Users can &quot;import&quot; more objects by pointing to a python file with SimObject classes defined
      - SimObjects will be initialized in the GUI, which will allow users to modify the parameters for a specific instance of that SimObject
    - An object can be selected, which will bring up its modifiable parameters which will allow the user the change them as necessary
    - Connecting two objects is a matter of dragging a wire from one **port** to another
- As a user, I can easily modify simulation object parameters to easily configure and test different systems

    - Some parameters will have default settings based on the type of object selected
 In the attribute selection view hovering over each parameter should display a description of that parameter
- Users can save model files and access them later to make cross system development easier.
- As a researcher, I can easily design and test new architectures to shorten the development time.

    - The software should be able to manage multiple designs and load multiple files without any significant performance hit. The most expensive operation should happen at file export, where (ideally) code is generated for a user to run with the gem5 compiler.

Should Haves:

- Users can export the model into a JSON file format

    - The current plan is to allow the user to export to different files formats, like a python configuration script, for the obvious purpose of allowing users to continue development in Python if necessary. The actual simulator will be a tertiary feature that we&#39;ll account later down the line
- Users can create new simulation objects derived from existing objects to develop new architectures.
- As a user I will be able to select multiple objects and save them to the aforementioned catalog.
- Users can use shortcut keys (hot keys) to perform common tasks such as selecting a wire or run simulation.

    - Copy, Paste, Cut, multiple selection (will not bring up an attribute screen but will allow multiple objects to be moved around)

Could Haves:

- Besides a JSON file, users can export a design to multiple file formats, primarily to a python configuration script that can be essentially immediately run.
- As a user, I can visualize simulation results and compare results between different simulations and architectures to easily compare and contrast different systems.
- Users can run simulations from the GUI directly via a one click simulation button to shorten development time.
- Parameterize objects and run multiple simulations in parallel over these object parameters in order to determine the optimal configurations.

### 6.3 FAQ 

#### 6.3.1 How do I know if I am in the wire drawing mode or selection mode?

- When in wire drawing mode, the wire tool icon will be &quot;pressed&quot; and the cursor will become a crosshair.

#### 6.3.2 How frequently is the catalog updated?

- The catalog is dynamically loaded from the gem5 repository whenever the GUI is launched.

#### 6.3.3 I instantiated a model but I forgot to specify some parameters, how can I modify them?

- Unfortunately, you cannot modify the model after instantiation because objects cannot be deleted and created again. To change parameters, open a new GUI file and load your saved UI file.

#### 6.3.4 How come when I place objects very near to each other but not overlapping they get added as children?

- The resize handles of the object are included in the collision detection between objects, so if they overlap (even when invisible) the GUI will interpret the action as placing an object in another.


### 6.4 Glossary

- SimObject: a standard gem5 object
- SymObject: a UI object with a pointer to the gem5 SimObject
- QWidget: the base class object for all UI objects, used as a basis for SymObjects
- QMainWindow: the base class for window management, used for the GUI layout

## 7. Future

Over the course of development, we have faced hurdles and came up with new ideas which we later implemented. We were therefore unable to allocate time to develop everything we had originally planned. Future development should focus on these features, as well as others that we believe are desired:

- Export to multiple file formats (current instantiation generates config.json)
- Visualization of simulation results, with comparison to other simulations
- Parameterize objects to allow for running multiple simulations in parallel and comparing results / identifying optimal parameter values
